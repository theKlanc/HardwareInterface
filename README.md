Platform abstraction layer for 3DS, Vita and PC (SFML)

Current version: 0.1

Updates will probably break older code. Code-breaking changes will be well documented.

Sound will be changed completely, and it currently doesn't probably work on PC or Vita

Define _3DS , WIN32 or _VITA on your preprocessor to compile for each specific platform
