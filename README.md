Platform abstraction layer for 3DS, Vita and PC (SFML)

Current version: 0.1

Updates will probably break older code. Code-breaking changes will be well documented.

Sound will be changed completely, and it currently doesn't probably work on PC or Vita

Define _3DS , WIN32 or _VITA on your preprocessor to compile for each specific platform

The VS template is tailored for my personal paths, adjust each setting by renaming the paths. All non-default settings should be bold, so it shouldn't take too much to take a quick glance at each page and adjust paths if necessary. PC config doesn't need to be modified as long as SFML is located at C:\SFML
